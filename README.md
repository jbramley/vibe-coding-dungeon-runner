# Vibe Coding Dungeon Runner

Experimenting with [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) using [Claude 3.5 Haiku](https://claude.ai). 

The desired end product is a mash-up of [Scoundrel](http://stfj.net/art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf) and [Sorcery School](https://www.sorcery.school/).

Seeing how far I can on an inconsequential project with just vibes.
